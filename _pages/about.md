My research is primarily focused on understanding the cognitive processes that support the learning and use of language from infancy and beyond through computational modelling and behavioural experiments. Since September 2020, Iâ€™ve worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [ESRC LuCiD Centre](http://lucid.ac.uk/) in the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/institute-of-life-and-human-sciences/schools-and-departments/department-of-psychological-sciences/research/language-and-development/). I completed my PhD at the University of Liverpool in 2018, before joining the [Language Development Department](https://www.mpi.nl/departments/language-development) at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/) in Nijmegen. I also have a deep interest in statistics and research methodology, which has led me to contribute to the Language 0-5 Project as a data analysis consultant.
