My research is focused on understanding the cognitive processes that support the learning. I primarily study word learning in infancy using computational modelling and behavioural experiments. Since September 2020, I have worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [ESRC LuCiD Centre](http://lucid.ac.uk/) at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/institute-of-life-and-human-sciences/schools-and-departments/department-of-psychological-sciences/research/language-and-development/). I completed my PhD at the University of Liverpool in 2018, before joining the [Language Development Department](https://www.mpi.nl/departments/language-development) at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics](https://www.mpi.nl/) in Nijmegen. I have a deep interest in statistics and research methods, which has led me to contribute to the [Language 0-5 Project](http://www.lucid.ac.uk/what-we-do/research/language-0-5-project/) as a data analysis consultant.
